Daily update of financial, news and weather information

The daily update returns a python-based update of financial information such as the gold price, S&P 500 Index and VIX volatility score, a composite of news from subreddits, and gives the weather and temperature of the city in which you're located.  To access the APIs, you'll need to have a reddit account with an API key and register with Openweather maps.
